# Optical_Flow_Based_on_Duality_Method
The three elements of optical flow are as follows: optical flow produces velocity field; it is a carrier with information and optical properties such as pixels; it is a projection imaging of 3D scene motion to two-dimensional plane. It is the instantaneous velocity field generated by the motion of pixels with grayscale on the plane of the image.
